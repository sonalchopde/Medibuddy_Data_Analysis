# 🏥 MediBuddy Insurance Analysis – Capstone Project

## 📌 Project Overview
MediBuddy is a digital healthcare platform that provides **inpatient hospitalization, outpatient services, and corporate wellness benefits**. It simplifies the **health insurance process** by making it seamless, real-time, and paperless.

This project involves analyzing **two datasets** related to health insurance policies and claims to derive insights that can assist in **policy pricing and risk assessment**.

## 📂 Dataset Information
We have two datasets:
1. **Pre-health checkup data** – Includes **Age** and **BMI (Body Mass Index)** of policyholders before policy coverage.
2. **Personal details data** – Contains **number of dependents, smoking status, geographic location**, and other demographic details.

## 🎯 Analysis Objectives
This project aims to explore key factors affecting **insurance policies and claims**, answering the following questions:
- Does **gender** influence policy issuance?
- What is the **average amount** spent on each policy?
- Should policies vary based on **geographic location**?
- How does the **number of dependents** impact claim amounts?
- Is there a correlation between **BMI and insurance charges**?
- Does **smoking status** affect insurance pricing?
- How does **age impact claim amounts**?
- Can **BMI be used for offering discounts**?

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** for data processing & analysis
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive coding

## 🔍 Key Insights & Observations
### 📊 **Gender & Insurance Policies**
✔ **Observation:** Gender does not significantly influence policy issuance, as both genders receive almost equal coverage. However, men tend to pay **11.03% more** in premiums than women.
✔ **Actionable Insight:** Gender should not be a constraint in policy pricing, but cost variations can be examined further.

### 📊 **Average Cost Per Policy**
✔ **Observation:** The company spends a varying amount per policy, with different factors influencing costs.
✔ **Actionable Insight:** The company should optimize pricing based on risk factors rather than flat rates.

### 📊 **Geographic Variation in Policies**
✔ **Observation:** Some regions have **higher claim rates**, possibly due to local health risks or medical costs.
✔ **Actionable Insight:** Region-specific pricing models can be introduced for better risk management.

### 📊 **Dependents & Insurance Costs**
✔ **Observation:** A higher number of dependents **increases claim amounts**.
✔ **Actionable Insight:** Introduce **customized family plans** based on dependent counts.

### 📊 **BMI & Insurance Pricing**
✔ **Observation:** Higher **BMI correlates with increased insurance charges**, indicating a higher health risk.
✔ **Actionable Insight:** The company should consider **BMI-based risk pricing**.

### 📊 **Smoking & Insurance Premiums**
✔ **Observation:** **Smokers pay significantly higher premiums** than non-smokers due to increased health risks.
✔ **Actionable Insight:** Differentiate policies for smokers and adjust pricing accordingly.

### 📊 **Age & Claim Amounts**
✔ **Observation:** Older individuals **tend to file higher claims**, likely due to age-related health conditions.
✔ **Actionable Insight:** Introduce **age-based policy structures** to balance affordability and risk.

### 📊 **BMI & Discount Strategy**
✔ **Observation:** Policyholders with a **healthy BMI** incur lower medical costs.
✔ **Actionable Insight:** Offer **discounts for healthier individuals** to promote wellness and reduce risk.

## 📊 Visual Representations
This project includes visualizations such as:
- **Bar charts** for gender-based premium analysis
- **Line plots** for age vs. charges correlation
- **Scatter plots** for BMI and smoking impact
- **Box plots** for regional insurance trends
